I have been using a workflow wherein we create Liquibase changesets manually. However, this is far from ideal so I have started experimenting with some automation. The first step is to find the difference between the "baseline" database and the latest updates based on changesets, using the Liquibase [diff](http://www.liquibase.org/documentation/diff.html) tool. My goal is to start using `generateChangeLog` to automate changesets. I found additional `diff` command-line arguments here: [Liquibase Command Line](http://www.liquibase.org/documentation/command_line.html).
